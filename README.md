## Program Requirements

If you simply want to run the program a pre-compiled executable is available in
"DriveLogGUI/bin/Release/".

If you want to compile the program yourself, it will be necessary to install two
dependencies.

- spire.pdf-fe_3.2.msi
- spire.pdfviewer_2.12.msi

both available in the dependencies folder at root level. both dependencies will
have to be installed on the primary drive, often the C: drive.
This can be avoided by manually changing the programs references.
